PEM is applying for the following badges:

1. Available. We make PEM available on GitHub and also provide a docker image on Docker Hub.

2. Functional. We provide detailed instructions for reproducing the results in the paper.

3. Reusable. 

(1) We provide a runnable docker image that makes PEM easy to access.

(2) We not only provide the source code, but also provide an introduction to the core components of PEM (in `README-dev.md`).

(3) PEM is built on top of a well-known open-source project QEMU.
Further extension and development can be easily done on top of PEM.
To illustrate this point, we added AArch64 support to PEM with only around 200 lines of code.
Details are in Section 4.4 of the paper.

(4) Besides the specific use case of binary similarity, the probabilistic execution engine
of PEM can be easily modified to support other use cases.
It's essentially a dynamic analysis engine on QEMU's intermediate language.
Users can easily hook almost any operations (e.g., memory access, function call, etc.)
and redirect the execution flow with their own strategy.
