We provide a runnable docker image for the artifact evaluation.
In addition, for future research and development,
we provide the source code of PEM and a detailed instruction on how to compile it from the source code.

Please refer to [README-docker.md](README-docker.md) for the instructions of running PEM with the docker image.
It also contains the instructions for reproducing the results in the paper.

Please refer to [README-dev.md](README-dev.md) for the instructions of compiling PEM from the source code.
