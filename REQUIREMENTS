===Artifact Evaluation===
For the artifact evaluation, PEM requires `docker` to be installed.
We provide a runnable docker image for the artifact evaluation.
We recommend using a machine with at least 100GB of RAM and 8 CPU cores.
Most of the experiments should also work on a machine with 32GB of RAM and 4 CPU cores.

Running all the experiments may need around 200GB of disk space.
That is because PEM records the detailed execution information for further analysis.
The space usage can be reduced with minor engineering efforts.
We will improve it in the future.


===Further Development===
Please refer to `README-dev.md` for the instructions of compiling PEM from the source code.
